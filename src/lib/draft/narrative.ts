const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are drafting a section of an internal turbine-component inspection report ("I&A Report") for Allied Power Group, a turbine parts repair company. The audience is the customer receiving their equipment back and the internal reviewer who will edit this draft before it ships.

Style: concise, factual, engineering register. Short declarative sentences driven by counts and measurements (e.g. "Twenty-four (24) of ninety-two (92) buckets exhibit a linear indication on the platform."). No marketing language, no filler, no apologies, no meta-commentary about being an AI. Do not invent specific findings, counts, or defect locations that are not present in the data you were given — if the data doesn't support a claim, state what is and isn't known instead of guessing.

Format: match APG's usual report layout, which is short named categories with bullets underneath, not one flowing block of prose. Use this exact plain-text markup, one item per line:
- A short line ending in ":" (e.g. "Tips:", "Squealer Tip Thickness (E):") is an underlined subheading. Use one whenever the source material below groups into named categories.
- A line starting with "- " is a bullet under the subheading (or paragraph) immediately above it.
- A blank line separates one subheading+bullets (or paragraph) group from the next — don't add any other markup for spacing.
- A line starting with "NOTE:" is rendered bold and used only for the exact disclaimer text you're handed verbatim — never invent a new NOTE.
- Anything else is a plain paragraph line (one line in, one paragraph out — don't manually wrap long sentences).`;

/** Fixed lines that belong in every report of their kind regardless of job specifics — pulled
 * verbatim from a real completed report (Job #20443, the same job this template was
 * reverse-engineered from). Handed to the model as required quoted text rather than left to its

${categories.join("\n\n") || "(no dimensional data available)"}

APG's real report gives each category its own subheading (the category name exactly as given above, e.g. "Tip Height (D):") with one bullet stating its conclusion: "Inspected buckets are within APG criteria." when the fail count is 0, or "<N spelled out> (<N>) of the inspected buckets are outside APG criteria." otherwise (name the specific measurement if the category label makes it obvious, e.g. tip height being low or squealer tip thickness being below the printed minimum). If a category's data notes it only sampled part of the population, say so in that category's bullet rather than implying full coverage.

After all the category subheadings, add one closing paragraph stating the overall repairability conclusion based on the totals above (e.g. how many of the total buckets are repairable), then this exact line verbatim as its own paragraph, unmodified:
- "${STANDARD_PROCESS_LINES.dimensionalNote}"`,

/**
 * Builds the I&A Summary directly from job metadata and which source data is on hand — no LLM
 * call. This is the least mechanical of the four narrative sections, but the real report turned
 * out to be exactly this: the same fixed sentence skeleton every time (received → visual →
 * seal-strip/root-galling → dimensional → met-sample → airfoil-cleaning → FPI/visual), with only
 * the facts swapped in — confirmed by two supposedly-different completed jobs' report files
 * sharing near-identical wording apart from their specific facts. Optional bullets and clauses
 * (coating, prior repair, met-sample) only appear when that data is actually present, so a job
 * missing some of it still gets a correct, honest summary rather than an invented one.

The following sections have already been drafted elsewhere in the report; synthesize an overview from them rather than repeating their detail verbatim (their own subheadings/bullets are just context for you — don't copy that structure through here):
${combined}

Cover: what was received and inspected, the overall condition/findings at a high level, and whether the set is repairable. Do not introduce any facts not present in the sections above.

Unlike the other sections, APG's real I&A Summary does NOT use subheadings — it's a short sequence of plain paragraph sentences, several of which are followed immediately (no blank line, no subheading) by a couple of one-line bullets naming what that sentence covered. For example a sentence on visual inspection is followed by bullets on what the set was found to be (alloy, coating, prior repair — only ones you actually have data for); a sentence on dimensional inspection is followed by bullets just naming which checks were performed (not their results, which belong in the Dimensional Inspection Summary section already drafted above). Follow that same shape: short paragraph, then a tight run of "- " bullets right under it where the source material naturally groups into a short list, blank line before the next paragraph.

Two process lines are standard on every job and must appear verbatim, word-for-word, worked naturally into the narrative in this order: visual-inspection findings, then the seal-strip/root-galling line, then dimensional inspection, then (if a met-sample was taken) the met-sample line, then the airfoil-cleaning line, then FPI/visual inspection.

- "${STANDARD_PROCESS_LINES.airfoilCleaning}"`,
