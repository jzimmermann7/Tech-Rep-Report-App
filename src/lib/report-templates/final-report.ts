// Final Report -- reverse-engineered from a real completed deliverable (Job 18664, Fredrickson
// Power, plus notes from Jonathan on which exhibits are conditional vs. near-universal). Unlike
// the I&A Report, this has no narrative summary sections at all (no I&A Summary, FPI/Visual
// Summary, or Dimensional Summary -- those describe incoming findings, which this deliverable
// doesn't restate) -- just Recommended Repairs (reused from the I&A Report's own section/data,
// since it's the same underlying repair-router/CDS source either way) followed by a run of
// completion-stage re-checks and certifications. Section order here matches the real report's own
// page order as closely as this app's rendering pipeline supports (see renderReportHtml.ts's
// INLINE_ATTACH_SECTIONS): dimensional re-checks and true attach-as-is certifications /
// checklists are genuinely interleaved in the real document, not grouped separately.
//
// Per Jonathan: X-ray & airflow only apply to some jobs (no part-type allowlist, same "just
// missing when absent" pattern as the I&A Report's own Airflow Report); coating cert, shot
// peen/Al seal strip cert, and moment weigh apply to almost every job; heat treat charts and the
// damper pin check are also routine. All of these are genuinely optional at the file-matching
// level regardless -- a job that doesn't have a given exhibit's source file simply doesn't get
// that page, exactly the "conditional logic, not on every report" convention already established
// for the I&A Report's own optional sections.
