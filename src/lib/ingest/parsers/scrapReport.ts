/**
 * DS-0554's "scrap" tab -- a sub-sheet of the same Serial Number List workbook, not a separate
 * file. Layout (confirmed against Job 20591): sheet name contains "blade bucket scrap"; header
 * row 8 (APG #, Serial #, Scrap Reason, I&A, Pre-Weld, Post-Weld, Coat, Coat/Final -- the last
 * five are "place an X in the pertinent column" markers for which stage the part was scrapped
 * at, per row 6/7's own instructions); data starts row 9. Serial # is itself a formula reference
 * back into the main "...serial number sheet" tab (same bucket list, same row order), so every
 * bucket in the job always has a row here whether or not it was actually scrapped -- only the
 * ones with a Scrap Reason or a stage marker filled in are real scrap determinations. The sheet
 * also ends in a COUNTIF-formula totals row (blank APG #/Serial #) that must not be read as a
 * 93rd bucket.
 *
 * Jonathan's workflow (review indications/photos -> physically verify the part -> determine
 * scrap -> update this tab -> generate the report) means this genuinely starts out all-blank for
 * a job and fills in as review happens -- a blank result here is not a parsing failure, it's an
 * honest "nothing scrapped yet" (or "nothing ever will be"), and the caller (scanJobFolder.ts)
 * is expected to treat a zero-row result as valid, not as "needs attention."
